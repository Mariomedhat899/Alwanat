With the first news about Alwanat Ballet School in 2015 as the first ballet school in Upper Egypt, we began to realize the journey ahead — we had other artistic activities and could have skipped ballet, but we chose the harder path, learning from experiences that made us stronger and helped us understand the deep impact on every participating child, even up to age 25. Ballet in Minya became a message rejecting the idea that Upper Egypt is uncivilized and that girls don't have the right to practice an art form available in the capital; it clarified that ballet is an art that brings joy and great self-confidence, helping parents see deeper meaning beyond superficial judgments. It rejected bullying and the idea that any girl is unattractive, even from her own family, by showing her inner beauty through acceptance. Ballet stood against all forms of ugliness, proving that persistent beauty commands space and attention. It affirmed that self-perception and personal choices define true value, not others’ opinions. It encouraged every dream, reminding us it’s never too late. Ballet — like all art — remains a message of life through every crisis. And today, through a collection of photos featuring our most wonderful children, we reaffirm these messages and the values we continue to stand by. #Alwanat #Alwanat_Ballet_School
